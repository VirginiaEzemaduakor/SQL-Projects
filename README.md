# SQL-Projects
In this SQL-Projects, I used data definition languages to create database and data manipulation and data querying langauge to manipulate and query data to generate crucial insights. PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server was used to write the codes. I also modelled the data and analysed it by answering some important questions about each case study.
